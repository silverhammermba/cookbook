1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1/2 cup unsalted butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp cinammon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/4 cup water
6 apples

1. Peel, core, and slice the apples. Mix with cinammon and nutmeg.

2. Melt butter in a sauce pan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add white sugar, brown sugar and water; bring to a boil. Reduce temperature, and simmer 5 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
