Unclassified Chocolate Chip Cookies

The refrigeration time is absolutely crucial. They'd probably be good without it, but they won't be great like they will if you follow the recipe as written.

Chilling Time: at least 24 hours
Cooking Time: 14-16 minutes
Yield: 32-36 cookies
Ingredients
	*2 cups minus 2 tbsp (8.5 ounces) cake flour
	*1 2/3 cups (8.5 ounces) bread flour
	*1 1/4 tsp baking soda
	*1 1/2 tsp baking powder
	*1 1/2 tsp salt
	*2 1/2 sticks (1 1/4 cups) unsalted butter, at room temperature
	*1 1/4 cups (10 ounces) light brown sugar
	*1 cup plus 2 tbsp (8 ounces) granulated sugar
	*2 large eggs, at room temperature
	*2 tsp natural vanilla extract
	*2 bags (24 ounces total) chocolate chips
	
1. Sift flours, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a bowl. Set aside.

2. Using a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars together until very light, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds. Add chocolate chips and mix a few seconds to incorporate without grinding them into dust. Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours. Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.

3. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat.

4. Shape dough into balls of about 2 tbsp of dough. (I can fit 8 on a cookie sheet.) Bake until barely golden brown but still soft, 14-16 minutes. (The cookies will look slightly underdone but will set up beautifully while cooling.) Serve warm, if you can, and bask in the compliments.

5. You can also reserve dough and freeze for baking batches later. After refrigerating, shape the dough into balls and then freeze on a cookie sheet. After the dough is frozen, put the dough balls in a Ziploc bag. To bake the frozen dough, throw a couple balls on a parchment paper-line cookie sheet, and bake until barely browned, about 16 minutes.
