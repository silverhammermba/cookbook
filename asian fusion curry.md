## Ingredients ##

* ½ cup black lentils
* 6 ounces red potatoes, cut into small slices
* 1 tbsp ginger, grated or finely chopped
* 1 tbsp garlic, crushed or finely chopped
* 2 to 3 shallots, thinly sliced
* 1 bunch chard, stems and leaves separated, coarsely chopped

* ½ cup coconut milk
* ½ cup diced tomatoes
* 1 lime, juiced
* basil for garnish

## Directions ##

1. Cook the lentils
2. In a medium pot over medium-high heat, warm 1 to 2 tbsp oil. Add the
   potatoes, season with salt, and cook until slightly translucent, 3 to 5
   minutes.
3. Add the ginger, garlic, shallots, chard stems, and curry powder and cook
   until fragrant about 1 minute.
4. Add the broth, coconut milk, tomatoes, and 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil.
5. Reduce to a simmer and add the chard leaves. Cook 3 to 5 minutes until the
   potatoes are tender and the chard leaves are wilted.
6. Remove from the heat, stir in the lime juice and lentils.

Makes 2 big portions. Serve over rice or with naan.

## TODO ##

I think this could use more potato next time.
