This is my old roommate's family recipe for German pancakes (similar to crepes)
I've ever had!

Ingredients
===========
* 1 c flour
* 1.5 c milk
* 2 eggs

Options
------
* Can substitute water for milk
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract for added flavor

Makes ~7 pancakes, for 2-3 people

Directions
==========
Throw all ingredients in bowl. Mix thoroughly.

Use non stick pan. Heat up to med/high. Put ~1 tbsp of corn oil (peanut, vegetable, etc. work fine too) into pan. Spread around as evenly as possible. Drop a ladle full of mix into the center. Spread mix around in pan evenly by manipulating the pan. Flip when it cooks through. When it is beginning to brown on each side, it's done!

Enjoy by putting butter/jam/cinnamon sugar/syrup/whatever you like in the middle and rolling it up to form a delicious German pancake.
