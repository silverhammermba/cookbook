## Recipe ##

1. Preheat the oven to 300°F.
2. Spread the naan on a sheet pan in an even layer. Toast in the oven until
   crisp, 12 to 15 minutes then set aside.
3. In a medium pot over medium heat, warm 2 tablespoons oil until hot but not
   smoking.
4. Add the carrots, shallot, and garlic, season with salt and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften and caramelize, 3 to 5
   minutes.
5. Add the bulgur, soup spice blend, tomato paste, and as much Marash chile as
   you like, and stir to combine.
6. Season with salt and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
7. Add the lentils and 4 cups water and stir to blend.
8. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally,
   until the lentils and bulgur are tender, 18 to 20 minutes; stir in up to 1
   cup additional water if the soup appears too thick.
9. Remove from the heat; season to taste with salt and pepper.
9. Serve into individual bowls, garnished with the mint, yogurt, and the toasted
   naan croutons.
