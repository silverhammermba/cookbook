## Instructions ##

1. Rinse the quinoa and add to 1 cup salted water in a pot. Bring to boil, then
   simmer covered for 15-20 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
2. Cut the carrots into bite-sized pieces, chop
3. In a large frying pan over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon oil until hot

   cook until fragrant, about 10 seconds.

   carrots are tender, 6 to 8 minutes.

   salt and pepper.
7. Serve the quinoa topped with the chickpea mixture and yogurt dressing.
   Garnish with almond and cilantro.
