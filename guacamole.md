I just started using a molcajete and so got a new recipe. The only different
ingredient is the spices, so I'd like to experiment and see how they affect the
flavor. Both versions taste great.

## Non-molcajete version ##

### Ingredients ###

* 3 avocados, halved, seeded, and scooped
* 2 limes worth of juice
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp cayenne
* 1/2 medium onion, diced
* 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
* 2 roma tomatoes, seeded and diced
* 1 tbsp chopped cilantro

### Directions ###

1. In a medium mixing bowl, add avocados, lime juice, salt, cumin, and cayenne. Mash.
2. Fold in the rest of the ingredients

Makes 1qt of gaucamole.

## Molcajete version ##

### Ingredients ###

* 2 tbsp minced serrano pepper (or 3 tbsp jalapeno)
* 1/3 cup diced white onion
* 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
* kosher salt
* 3 roma tomatoes, seeded and diced (about 1 cup)
* 1 lime worth of juice
* 4 large avocados, halved, seeded, scooped

### Directions ###

1. Add the pepper, onion, and half the cilantro to the molcajete with 1/2 tsp of
   kosher salt. Grind to desired consistency (anywhere from small chunks to a
   paste)
2. Combine the avocados, pepper/onion paste, lime juice, and remaining cilantro
   in a mixing bowl and mash
3. Fold in the tomatoes and season with salt
