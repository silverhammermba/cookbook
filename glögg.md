Pop-pop's recipe, with my dad's modifications. For a boozier drink, add "1/2
quart cheap rye" along with the port.

Ingredients
-----------
* 3 liters port (ruby or tawny)
* 3 sticks cinammon
* 20 cloves
* 1 piece ginger, peeled
* 1x3" orange rind
* 1x3" lemon rind
* 3 cardamom pods (about 60 seeds)
* 1 cup golden raisins
* blanched almonds

Directions
----------
1. Put spices in a cheese cloth bag. Put spice bag and raisins in a large pot
   and cover with port.
2. Cook without boiling (<173°F) until flavor develops, about an hour.
3. Serve immediately. Add some raisins and almonds to each serving.

To store for later, discard spices and strain out raisins. Reheat individual
servings (with raisins and almonds) in the microwave for 30s–1min.
