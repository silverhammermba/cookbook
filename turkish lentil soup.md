## Ingredients ##

* 1 piece naan
* 3 ounces carrots
* 1 to 2 shallots
* Peeled fresh garlic
* ¼ cup bulgur
* Soup spice blend (fennel seeds - coriander - cumin - cinnamon)
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* ¼ teaspoon Marash chile flakes (optional)
* ¾ cup red lentils
* Fresh mint
* ½ cup Greek yogurt

## Recipe ##

1. Toast the naan
   1. Heat the oven or toaster oven to 300°F.
   2. Tear the naan into 1-inch pieces and spread on a sheet pan in an even layer. 
   3. Toast in the oven until crisp, 12 to 15 minutes then remove and set aside. 
2. Prep the soup ingredients
   1. Trim the tops from the carrots; scrub or peel them and cut into ¼-inch-thick slices.
   2. Peel and finely chop the shallot.
   3. Finely chop, press, or grate enough garlic to measure 1 teaspoon.
3. Cook the soup
   1. In a medium pot over medium heat, warm 2 tablespoons oil until hot but not smoking. 
   2. Add the carrots, shallot, and garlic, season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften and caramelize, 3 to 5 minutes. 
   3. Add the bulgur, soup spice blend, tomato paste, and as much Marash chile as you like, and stir to combine. 
   4. Season with salt and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
   5. Add the lentils and 4 cups water and stir to blend. 
   6. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the lentils and bulgur are tender, 18 to 20 minutes; stir in up to 1 cup additional water if the soup appears too thick. 
   7. Remove from the heat; season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. Prep the mint (just before serving) by coarsely chopping the leaves.
5. Serve into individual bowls, garnished with the mint, yogurt, and the toasted naan croutons.
