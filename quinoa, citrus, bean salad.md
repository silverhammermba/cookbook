### Ingredients ###

### Recipe ###

1. Rinse and cook the quinoa
   1. In a fine-mesh strainer, rinse the quinoa.
   2. In a small sauce pot, combine the quinoa and 1 cup lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until the quinoa is tender and the water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Fluff with a fork. 

2. Cook the beans
   1. Peel and thinly slice the shallot.
   2. In a fine-mesh strainer, rinse the beans.
   3. In a medium frying pan over medium heat, warm 1 to 2 teaspoons oil until hot but not smoking. 
   4. Add the shallot, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized, 4 to 5 minutes. 
   5. Add the beans and as much harissa powder as you like and cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans are warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. 

3. Make the salad
   1. Peel the oringes and cut into bite-size pieces. 
   2. Coarsely chop the almonds.
   3. Strip the mint leaves from the stems; coarsely chop the leaves.
   4. In a small bowl, stir together the sherry vinegar, 2 tablespoons oil, any orange juice that has collected; season to taste with salt and pepper. 
   5. To the bowl with the oranges, add the arugula, oranges, almonds, mint, and as much dressing as you like. Toss to coat.

4. Transfer the warm quinoa to individual bowls, and top with the orange-arugula salad, the warm beans and crumbled ricotta salata.
