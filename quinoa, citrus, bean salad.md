## Ingredients ##

* ½ cup rainbow quinoa, rinsed
* 1 or 2 shallots, peeled, thinly sliced
* ¾ cup cooked white beans, rinsed
* ½ teaspoon harissa powder (optional)
* 2 blood oranges
* 1 Cara Cara orange
* 1/3 cup almonds, coarsely chopped
* Fresh mint, coarsely chopped
* 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
* ¼ pound baby arugula
* 1½ ounces ricotta salata

## Recipe ##

1. In a small sauce pot, combine the quinoa and 1 cup lightly salted water and
   bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until the quinoa is
   tender and the water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
2. In a medium frying pan over medium heat, warm 1 to 2 teaspoons oil until hot
   but not smoking. Add the shallot, season with salt, and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until caramelized, 4 to 5 minutes.
3. Add the beans and as much harissa powder as you like and cook, stirring
   occasionally, until the beans are warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes.
4. Peel the oranges and cut into bite-size pieces.
5. Strip the mint leaves from the stems; coarsely chop the leaves.
6. In a small bowl, stir together the sherry vinegar, 2 tablespoons oil, and any
   orange juice that has collected; season to taste with salt and pepper.
7. To the bowl with the oranges, add the arugula, oranges, almonds, mint, and as
   much oil and vinegar dressing as you like. Toss to coat.
8. Transfer the warm quinoa to individual bowls, and top with the orange-arugula
   salad, the warm beans and crumbled ricotta salata.
