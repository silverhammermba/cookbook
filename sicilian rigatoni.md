## Ingredients ##

* ¾ pound cauliflower, cut into florets
* 1 red onion, thinly sliced
* 5 ounces rigatoni
* 1 ounce pine nuts
* 1 orange, zested and peeled
* Fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, coarsely chopped
* Fresh thyme leaves, coarsely chopped
* ¼ cup currants
* ½ teaspoon piment d’ville (optional)
* ½ cup fresh ricotta

## Recipe ##

1. Preheat the oven to 450ºF.
2. Cut the cauliflower florets into halves
3. On a sheet pan, toss the cauliflower and onion with 1 tablespoon oil and season with salt and pepper. 
4. Spread in an even layer, cauliflower cut sides down, and roast until golden brown and just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. 
5. Cook the rigatoni and drain, reserving ¼ cup pasta cooking water.
6. In a dry small frying pan over medium-low heat, toast the pine nuts, stirring often, until golden brown and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool.
7. Working over a small bowl, cut between the membranes of the orange to release the segments into the bowl. Discard any seeds.
8. Strip the parsley and thyme leaves from the stems; coarsely chop the leaves.
9. Return the rigatoni and the reserved pasta cooking water to the sauce pot and
   bring to a boil. 
9. Stir in the cauliflower, onion, pine nuts, orange zest and segments, parsley,
   thyme, currants, and as much piment d’ville as you like and cook until the
   flavors meld and the pasta is hot, 1 to 2 minutes. 
9. Remove from the heat, stir in the ricotta, and season to taste with salt and
   pepper.
