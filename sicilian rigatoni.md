## Ingredients ##

* ¾ pound cauliflower
* 1 red onion
* 5 ounces rigatoni
* 1 ounce pine nuts
* 1 orange
* Fresh flat-leaf parsley
* Fresh thyme
* ¼ cup currants
* ½ teaspoon piment d’ville (optional)
* ½ cup fresh ricotta

## Recipe ##

1. Roast the cauliflower and onion
   1. Heat the oven to 450ºF.
   2. Cut the cauliflower into florets, discarding any leaves or thick stalks. Cut the florets in half lengthwise.
   3. Peel and thinly slice the red onion.
   4. On a sheet pan, toss the cauliflower and onion with 1 tablespoon oil and season with salt and pepper. 
   5. Spread in an even layer, cut sides down, and roast until golden brown and just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. 

2. Cook the rigatoni 
   1. Follow package instructions
   2. Drain, reserving ¼ cup pasta cooking water. 

3. Toast the pine nuts
   1. In a dry small frying pan over medium-low heat, toast the pine nuts, stirring often, until golden brown and fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. 
   2. Transfer to a plate to cool.

4. Prep the orange and herbs
   1. Zest the orange. Using your hands or a sharp knife, peel the orange; working over a small bowl, cut between the membranes to release the segments into the bowl. Discard any seeds.
   2. Strip the parsley and thyme leaves from the stems; coarsely chop the leaves.

5. Finish the rigatoni
   1. Return the rigatoni and the reserved pasta cooking water to the sauce pot and bring to a boil. 
   2. Stir in the cauliflower, onion, pine nuts, orange zest and segments, parsley, thyme, currants, and as much piment d’ville as you like and cook until the flavors meld and the pasta is hot, 1 to 2 minutes. 
   3. Remove from the heat, stir in the ricotta, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
