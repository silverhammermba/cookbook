## Ingredients ##

* 1 pound sweet potatoes, peeled, grated, rinsed, and dried
* 3 scallions, thinly sliced
* 2 eggs
* ½ cup Greek yogurt
* 1 tsp grated horseradish (optional)

### Quantities estimated ###

* 1/4 cup flour

Spices totalling maybe 1 tbsp?

* coriander
* smoked paprika
* sumac

## Instructions ##

1. Preheat the oven to 325ºF
2. Mix the flour, coriander, paprika, and sumac
3. Combine the grated sweet potatoes with the scallions, eggs, spice
   blend, and 1 tablespoon of yogurt. Season generously with salt and pepper. If
   too dry, add up to ¼ cup water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until just moist.
4. In a pan over medium-high heat, warm 1 to 2 tablespoons oil until hot but not
   smoking. Working in batches, spoon in the batter about ½ cup at a time,
   pressing lightly with the back of a spatula to make 3 to 4 fritters about 3
   inches wide and about ¼ inch thick. Cook until brown and crisp, 4 to 5
   minutes per side. Transfer to a paper-towel-lined sheet pan and keep warm in
   the oven until you finish all of them
5. Serve topped with yogurt (optionally mixed with horseradish)

Makes 6 to 8 fritters total. Serves well with a sweet side salad (apples).
