1 cup sugar
1 stick unsalted butter
2 eggs
3 bananas
1 tbsp milk
1 tsp cinammon
2 cups flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
3/4 cup walnuts
1/2-1 tsp of vanilla

1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Butter a 9 x 5 x 3 inch loaf pan.

2. Cream the sugar and butter in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.

3. In a small bowl, mash the bananas with a fork. Mix in the milk, vanilla, and cinnamon. In another bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.

4. Add the banana mixture to the creamed mixture and stir until combined. Add dry ingredients, mixing just until flour disappears.

5. Pour batter into prepared pan (cover with oiled foil to prevent drying) and bake 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Set aside to cool on a rack for 15 minutes. Remove bread from pan, invert onto rack and cool completely before slicing.
