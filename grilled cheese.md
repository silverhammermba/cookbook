From [Food Wishes](http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2010/05/inside-out-grilled-cheese-sandwich.html).

1. Melt the butter in the pan on medium-low heat
2. Place both slices of bread in the pan, top one slice with cheese
3. Once the bread is hot (a couple minutes), put the non-cheesed slice on top,
   hot side up.
4. Immediately sprinkle more cheese (not a lot!) on top
5. Flip the sandwich and repeat step 4.
6. Grill on both sides until the outside cheese is crispy and caramelized (3â€“4
   minutes per-side). You may need to add more butter between flips.
