Ingredients
===========

Dry stuff
---------
* 1 2/3 cup flour
* 3/4 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 3/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/3 cup sugar

Liquids
-------
* 3/4 cup (1.5 sticks) butter
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 egg

The tasty bits
--------------
* 1 3/4 cup chocolate chips (11.5 oz bag)
* 1 cup coconut
* 1 cup oatmeal
* 1 cup chopped walnuts

Yields 3-4 dozen

People say you're supposed to mix the liquids with the sugars separately and
then mix that with the flour and stuff. And that you're not supposed to melt
the butter. Who has the time? Sometimes you just want a cookie, you know?

1. Melt the butter and mix all the stuff in one bowl at pretty much the same time
2. Put the chocolate, coconut, oatmeal, and walnuts in last
3. Bake at 375 degrees for 8-11 minutes
