Thanks to Chef John.

== Ingredients ==

* 6 thick slices of stale bread
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup of milk
* pinch of salt
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1/2 tsp cinammon
* 1/4 tsp allspice
* butter

== Instructions ==

1. Mix all ingredients (other than the bread and butter) in a large bowl.
2. Put the bread slices in the bowl. Try to get the bread to absorb *all* the
   liquid.
3. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 400Â° and melt a tablespoon or two of butter in
   a large pan on medium-low.
4. *Lightly* brown the bread slices in the pan on both sides. You want these
   light and golden, maybe 1-2 minutes per side.
5. Transfer bread to a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes (they might look
   done around 12 but the insides are not).
